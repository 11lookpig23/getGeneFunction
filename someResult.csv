MCM9,"Component of the MCM8-MCM9 complex, a complex involved in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DBSs) and DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) by homologous recombination (HR) (PubMed:23401855). Required for DNA resection by the MRE11-RAD50-NBN/NBS1 (MRN) complex by recruiting the MRN complex to the repair site and by promoting the complex nuclease activity (PubMed:26215093). Probably by regulating the localization of the MRN complex, indirectly regulates the recruitment of downstream effector RAD51 to DNA damage sites including DBSs and ICLs (PubMed:23401855). Acts as a helicase in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) following DNA replication errors to unwind the mismatch containing DNA strand (PubMed:26300262). In addition, recruits MLH1, a component of the MMR complex, to chromatin (PubMed:26300262). The MCM8-MCM9 complex is dispensable for DNA replication and S phase progression (PubMed:23401855). Probably by regulating HR, plays a key role during gametogenesis (By similarity)."
NSUN6,"S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase that specifically methylates the C5 position of cytosine 72 in tRNA(Thr)(TGT) and tRNA(Cys)(GCA) (PubMed:26160102, PubMed:27703015, PubMed:28531330). In vitro also methylates tRNA(Thr)(AGT) (PubMed:27703015, PubMed:26160102). Methylation requires, in the acceptor stem region, the presence of the 3'-CCA terminus, the target site C72, the discriminator base U73, and the second and third base pairs (2:71 and 3:70) in the tRNA substrates (PubMed:26160102, PubMed:27703015)."
HS6ST2,6-O-sulfation enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to position 6 of the N-sulfoglucosamine residue (GlcNS) of heparan sulfate.
SEC16B,"Plays a role in the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES), also known as transitional endoplasmic reticulum (tER). Required for secretory cargo traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (PubMed:17192411, PubMed:21768384, PubMed:22355596). Involved in peroxisome biogenesis. Regulates the transport of peroxisomal biogenesis factors PEX3 and PEX16 from the ER to peroxisomes (PubMed:21768384)."
METAP1D,"Removes the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins. The N-terminal methionine is often cleaved when the second residue in the primary sequence is small and uncharged (Met-Ala-, Cys, Gly, Pro, Ser, Thr, or Val). Requires deformylation of the N(alpha)-formylated initiator methionine before it can be hydrolyzed (By similarity). May play a role in colon tumorigenesis."
CLPS,"Colipase is a cofactor of pancreatic lipase. It allows the lipase to anchor itself to the lipid-water interface. Without colipase the enzyme is washed off by bile salts, which have an inhibitory effect on the lipase."
MFSD3,NO-text
MSRB1,"Methionine-sulfoxide reductase that specifically reduces methionine (R)-sulfoxide back to methionine. While in many cases, methionine oxidation is the result of random oxidation following oxidative stress, methionine oxidation is also a post-translational modification that takes place on specific residue. Acts as a regulator of actin assembly by reducing methionine (R)-sulfoxide mediated by MICALs (MICAL1, MICAL2 or MICAL3) on actin, thereby promoting filament repolymerization. Plays a role in innate immunity by reducing oxidized actin, leading to actin repolymerization in macrophages."
TDRP,"Contributes to normal sperm motility, but not essential for male fertility."
BPIFA2,Has strong antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa.
PELI2,"E3 ubiquitin ligase catalyzing the covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties onto substrate proteins. Involved in the TLR and IL-1 signaling pathways via interaction with the complex containing IRAK kinases and TRAF6. Mediates IL1B-induced IRAK1 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination and possibly 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination. May be important for LPS- and IL1B-induced MAP3K7-dependent, but not MAP3K3-dependent, NF-kappa-B activation. Can activate the MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase pathway leading to activation of ELK1."
KCNJ8,"This potassium channel is controlled by G proteins. Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium. Can be blocked by external barium (By similarity)."
ENTPD3,Has a threefold preference for the hydrolysis of ATP over ADP.
RASA4,"Ca(2+)-dependent Ras GTPase-activating protein, that switches off the Ras-MAPK pathway following a stimulus that elevates intracellular calcium. Functions as an adaptor for Cdc42 and Rac1 during FcR-mediated phagocytosis."
TSPAN33,"Plays an important role in normal erythropoiesis (By similarity). It has a role in the differentiation of erythroid progenitors (By similarity). Regulates maturation and trafficking of the transmembrane metalloprotease ADAM10 (PubMed:26686862, PubMed:30463011). Negatively regulates ligand-induced Notch activity probably by regulating ADAM10 activity (PubMed:26686862). Mediates docking of ADAM10 to zonula adherens by interacting with ADAM10 and, in a PDZD11-dependent manner, with the zonula adherens protein PLEKHA7 (PubMed:30463011)."
DTD2,"Deacylates mischarged D-aminoacyl-tRNAs (By similarity). Probably acts by rejecting L-amino acids from its binding site rather than specific recognition of D-amino acids (By similarity). Catalyzes the hydrolysis of D-tyrosyl-tRNA(Tyr), has no activity on correctly charged L-tyrosyl-tRNA(Tyr) (By similarity). By recycling D-aminoacyl-tRNA to D-amino acids and free tRNA molecules, this enzyme counteracts the toxicity associated with the formation of D-aminoacyl-tRNA entities in vivo and helps enforce protein L-homochirality. In contrast to DTD1, deacylates L-Ala mischarged on tRNA(Thr)(G4.U69) by alanine-tRNA ligase AARS (PubMed:29410408). Can deacylate L-Ala due to a relaxed specificity for substrate chirality caused by the trans conformation of the Gly-Pro motif in the active site (PubMed:29410408). Also hydrolyzes correctly charged, achiral, glycyl-tRNA(Gly) in vitro, although in vivo EEF1A1/EF-Tu may protect cognate achiral glycyl-tRNA(Gly) from DTD2-mediated deacetylation (By similarity)."
UPF3A,"Involved in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs containing premature stop codons by associating with the nuclear exon junction complex (EJC) and serving as link between the EJC core and NMD machinery. Recruits UPF2 at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope and the subsequent formation of an UPF1-UPF2-UPF3 surveillance complex (including UPF1 bound to release factors at the stalled ribosome) is believed to activate NMD. However, UPF3A is shown to be only marginally active in NMD as compared to UPF3B. Binds spliced mRNA upstream of exon-exon junctions. In vitro, weakly stimulates translation."
